## Introduction

This module generates the javascript to include in a DApp via a script tag.
It creates an iframe that loads the Torus page and sets up communication streams between
the iframe and the DApp javascript context.

## Features

- Typescript compatible. Includes Type definitions

## Installation

### Bundling

This module is distributed in 3 formats

- `esm` build `dist/torus.esm.js` is es6 format
- `commonjs` build `dist/torus.cjs.js` in es5 format
- `umd` build `dist/torus.umd.min.js` in es5 format without polyfilling corejs minified

By default, the appropriate format is used for your specified usecase
You can use a different format (if you know what you're doing) by referencing the correct file

The cjs build is not polyfilled with core-js.
It is upto the user to polyfill based on the browserlist they target

### Directly in Browser

CDN's serve the non-core-js polyfilled version by default. You can use a different

jsdeliver

```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@toruslabs/solana-embed"></script>
```

unpkg

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@toruslabs/solana-embed"></script>
```

### Tips for NUXT

This is a plugin that works [only on the client side](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins/#client-side-only). So please register it as a ssr-free plugin.

## Usage

Please refer to the [examples](examples) folder for details on usage using dynamic import.

## Rehydration

Torus uses `window.sessionStorage` to store user details.

So, if the user reloads the page, all his data would be rehydrated and the user doesn't need to log in.

The samples provided in the [examples](examples) folder illustrate the above case.
